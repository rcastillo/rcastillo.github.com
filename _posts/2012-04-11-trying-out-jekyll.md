##Getting Started
I am trying out this minimalist (not blogging platform).  In general I mostly write about software so Jekyll seemed like a good medium to author a blog. I do get the feeling that I am compiling my blog when I working on it. It is sort of the same feeling I get when Latex'ing my resume.  Oddly impractical but strangely satisfying.
